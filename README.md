## 🔒 API Key Security Note

The version of this project deployed on **GitHub Pages** includes a working Unsplash **Access Key (Client ID)** hardcoded in the JavaScript file.

**Please Note:**
* This is a **dedicated, public-facing key** used *solely* for the live demo to function.
* This key provides **read-only access** (image searching) and is **not** used for any sensitive data or production applications.
* The highly confidential **Unsplash Secret Key** is **never** included or exposed.
* **Best Practice:** When running this project locally or integrating it into your own applications, you should always replace this key with your own unique Access Key.
